# Transportation Systems Docker Environment

The purpose of this repo is to create a Docker Environment to be used for development and deployment of the 2018 Hack Oregon Transportation Systems project.

It will also provide some introductory information into Docker to help our volunteers get up and running in this project season.

## Getting Started - What is Docker?

If you are not familiar with Docker, your first step should be understanding the basics of Docker, ie how it works, some terms, and how it is different then running a full virtual machine like Vagrant.

I would suggest watching this video to get a short introduction into Docker:

This is also a great guide to review:

Next, you will need to install Docker if you have not already
